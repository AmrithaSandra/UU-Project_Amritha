## Project title: Analyzing and visualizing the online gas evolutionÂ from Lithium-ion batteries

Develop a Python program to analyze and visualize online gas evolution data acquired from a mass spectrometer. Gas evolution is investigated online by combining mass spectrometry and potentiostat by connecting with a battery. The project aims to develop an algorithm that can import data files, show the gases produced at each cycling phase simultaneously, and calculate the gases in terms of moles. Additionally, investigates the impact of temperature and pressure on gas evolution.
