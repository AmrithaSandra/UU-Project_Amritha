## Project Title: Analyzing and visualizing the online gas evolutionÂ from Lithium-ion batteries

Develop a Python program to analyze and visualize online gas evolution data acquired from a mass spectrometer. Gas evolution is investigated online by combining mass spectrometry and potentiostat by connecting with a battery. The project aims to develop an algorithm that can import data files, show the gases produced at each cycling phase simultaneously, and calculate the gases in terms of moles. Additionally, investigates the impact of temperature and pressure on gas evolution.
  1. Loading the files with different formats.
  2. Isolating the specific cycles of the dataset from the potentiostat.
  3. Mass spec data analysis 
  4. Create an algorithm for converting the raw data of gases into the number of moles.
  5. Using matplotlib visualize the data of both the potential and the number of moles of the gases. Merging these curves in one plot can give more information about gas evolution in each step of the voltage curve.
  6. Create an algorithm to study the effect of temperature and pressure.
